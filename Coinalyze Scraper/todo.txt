Finished: 
- WaveTrend works but I need to impliment the divergences and other buy signals


Work on: 
- Learn how to make a base abstract exchange class you can loop though and create connections to
- Recode the starting point of the program and find out a better way to do it
- Create a GUI
- Finish the function that checks each new bar for a signal
- Maybe take away the pandas column names for the final wavetrend version so it will run faster
- Make a better method to run the program in a loop every x seconds
    time.sleep(seconds) works well
- Check to see if the exchange kicks you again when it calls the history over and over again
- Function to get Market Price:
    orderbook = exchange.fetch_order_book (exchange.symbols[0])
    bid = orderbook['bids'][0][0] if len (orderbook['bids']) > 0 else None
    ask = orderbook['asks'][0][0] if len (orderbook['asks']) > 0 else None
    spread = (ask - bid) if (bid and ask) else None
    print (exchange.id, 'market price', { 'bid': bid, 'ask': ask, 'spread': spread })
