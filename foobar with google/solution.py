Commander Lambda is all about efficiency, including using her the bunny workers for manual labor. But no one's been properly monitoring the labor shifts for a while and they've gotten quite mixed up. You've been given the task of fixing them, but after you wrote up new shifts you realized that some bunny workers had been transferred to a different area and aren't available for their assigned shifts. Manually sorting through each shift list to compare against work area lists will take forever -- remember, Commander Lambda loves efficiency!

Given two almost identical lists of worker IDs x and y where one of the lists contains an additional ID, write a function solution(x, y) that compares the lists and returns the additional ID.

For example, given the lists x = [13, 5, 6, 2, 5] and y = [5, 2, 5, 13], the function solution(x, y) would return 6 because the list x contains the integer 6 and the list y doesn't. Given the lists x = [14, 27, 1, 4, 2, 50, 3, 1] and y = [2, 4, -4, 3, 1, 1, 14, 27, 50], the function solution(x, y) would return -4 because the list y contains the integer -4 and the list x doesn't.

In each test case, the lists x and y will always contain n non-unique integers where n is at least 1 but never more than 99, and one of the lists will contain an additional unique integer which should be returned by the function. The same n non-unique integers will be present on both lists, but they might appear in a different order like in the examples above. Commander Lambda likes to keep the numbers short, so every worker ID will be between -1000 and 1000.

Commander Lambda loves efficiency and hates anything that wastes time. The Commander is a busy lamb, after all! Henchmen who identify sources of inefficiency and come up with ways to remove them are generously rewarded. You've spotted one such source, and you think solving it will help you build the reputation you need to get promoted.

Every time the Commander's employees pass each other in the hall, each of them must stop and salute each other -- one at a time -- before resuming their path. A salute is five seconds long, so each exchange of salutes takes a full ten seconds (Commander Lambda's salute is a bit, er, involved). You think that by removing the salute requirement, you could save several collective hours of employee time per day. But first, you need to show the Commander how bad the problem really is.

Write a program that counts how many salutes are exchanged during a typical walk along a hallway. The hall is represented by a string. For example:
"--->-><-><-->-"

Each hallway string will contain three different types of characters: '>', an employee walking to the right; '<', an employee walking to the left; and '-', an empty space. Every employee walks at the same speed either to right or to the left, according to their direction. Whenever two employees cross, each of them salutes the other. They then continue walking until they reach the end, finally leaving the hallway. In the above example, they salute 10 times.

Write a function solution(s) which takes a string representing employees walking along a hallway and returns the number of times the employees will salute. s will contain at least 1 and at most 100 characters, each one of -, >, or <.

"""

Commander Lambda uses an automated algorithm to assign minions randomly to tasks, in order to keep minions on their toes. But you've noticed a flaw in the algorithm -- it eventually loops back on itself, so that instead of assigning new minions as it iterates, it gets stuck in a cycle of values so that the same minions end up doing the same tasks over and over again. You think proving this to Commander Lambda will help you make a case for your next promotion. 

You have worked out that the algorithm has the following process: 

1) Start with a random minion ID n, which is a nonnegative integer of length k in base b
2) Define x and y as integers of length k.  x has the digits of n in descending order, and y has the digits of n in ascending order
3) Define z = x - y.  Add leading zeros to z to maintain length k if necessary
4) Assign n = z to get the next minion ID, and go back to step 2

For example, given minion ID n = 1211, k = 4, b = 10, then x = 2111, y = 1112 and z = 2111 - 1112 = 0999. Then the next minion ID will be n = 0999 and the algorithm iterates again: x = 9990, y = 0999 and z = 9990 - 0999 = 8991, and so on.

Depending on the values of n, k (derived from n), and b, at some point the algorithm reaches a cycle, such as by reaching a constant value. For example, starting with n = 210022, k = 6, b = 3, the algorithm will reach the cycle of values [210111, 122221, 102212] and it will stay in this cycle no matter how many times it continues iterating. Starting with n = 1211, the routine will reach the integer 6174, and since 7641 - 1467 is 6174, it will stay as that value no matter how many times it iterates.

Given a minion ID as a string n representing a nonnegative integer of length k in base b, where 2 <= k <= 9 and 2 <= b <= 10, write a function solution(n, b) which returns the length of the ending cycle of the algorithm above starting with n. For instance, in the example above, solution(210022, 3) would return 3, since iterating on 102212 would return to 210111 when done in base 3. If the algorithm reaches a constant, such as 0, then the length is 1.
